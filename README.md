DREDGE Hardcore Mode, work in progress. Currently does the following:

- Harvesting minigames are way harder
- Difficulty for minigames can be adjusted in their config files
- Days are slightly shorter, nights slightly longer
- Sleeping is not very efficient, except when sleeping on land
- Catching aberrated fish increases (in)sanity level
